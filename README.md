# Reuqsts for Comments (RFCs)
Repository containing Requests for Comments (RFCs) for the development of Avail, the essential base layer for modern blockchains.

Building Avail and the Avail ecosystem is a community effort, therefore we welcome anyone to provide feedback on the proposed protocol and implementation changes. As well as propose changes on their own. 

This is an evolving process and we want to keep it lightweight in the beginning. Once Avail is closer to Mainnet, and the rate of change has changed, we will adapt the RFC process itself.

## Proposing new ideas

Do you have an idea how to improve Avail?
1. Head over to the Ideas section on our [discussions](https://github.com/availproject/RFCs/discussions) page.
2. Once your idea has been discussed and you are happy to create a more detailed specification for the idea, you can submit it as an RFC in the RFC section of of the [discussions](https://github.com/availproject/RFCs/discussions) page.
3. Use the Example RFC as a template for your RFC. 
4. Mark the RFC with the `Draft` label. 
5. Share the RFC on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/y6fHnxZQX8). It is up to you to drive the discussion and get sufficient feedback.
6. Once the RFC has been accepted by at least 2 core developers, change the label to 'Ready for implementation'.
